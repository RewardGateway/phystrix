     * TestCommand[TIMEOUT][1ms]

     * GetData[SUCCESS][1ms], PutData[SUCCESS][1ms], GetValues[SUCCESS][1ms], GetValues[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][1ms], TestCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_FAILURE][1ms], TestCommand[FAILURE,
     * FALLBACK_FAILURE, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][1ms]
     *
     * If a command has a multiplier such as <code>x4</code>, that means this command was executed 4 times with the same events. The time in milliseconds is the sum of the 4 executions.
     *
     * For example, <code>TestCommand[SUCCESS][15ms]x4</code> represents TestCommand being executed 4 times and the sum of those 4 executions was 15ms. These 4 each executed the run() method since
     * <code>RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE</code> was not present as an event.
